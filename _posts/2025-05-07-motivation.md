### Project Focus

I'm planning on building an MCU Directory. This is a platform designed for Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) fans, friends of MCU fans, and enjoyers of cinema. Since the MCU is a HUGE project with a complex web of storylines, my project will help users pinpoint which movies one should watch to enjoy an MCU film. This will include only movies in the Multiverse Saga (so 2021 onward). If I have time, I'll add a summary of these movies for those on a time crunch. An MCU Directory is interesting, because as mentioned earlier, the MCU is really complex, and so there is no pattern to what movies to watch before. This makes my process both time and labor consuming. However, it'll be really interesting to see how it pans out.

### Why This Project 

I'm a fairly new MCU fan myself, but I've caught myself up quickly over half a year. The idea for this project came around the time when *Captain America: Brave New World* came out, and I wanted to see it with my friends (most have watched two MCU movies max). I ended up doing a lot of exposition both before and during the movie. I hope to share my directory with my friends so that should they chose to watch upcoming movies, it'll be an actually enjoyable experience. I think that this project offers a good level of novelty relative to what we've learned in Programming Fundamentals; we've learned most of the stuff I plan on using, but I'm just scaling it up and implementing a lot more user interaction.

### What I Want to Learn

I want to strengthen my use of large data structures and conditionals. These are things I've sort of struggled with using in context over the semester, and I predict that they'll be a critical component of my project. Beyond coding, I want to work on making my code as user-friendly and streamlined as possible.



### My Approach 

I've already started the user-input portion of my project. Additionally, I've created a rough function for the standalone movies (so ones that don't really hinge on previous projects). I'll focus first on creating data structures for the remaining movies, before creating conditionals to determine which ones are relevant to the user-inputted movie. Since I'm creating this largely for my friends and I have a pretty small user-input set, I'll be done when my friends can easily use it, and all my selected movies output properly. Obviously the latter should come first, and will require polishing before I can try the former.

### What's Next

Next, I want to lay out a data structure for the remaining movies. This is more time consuming, but will make future steps a lot easier, as then I'll just have to write conditionals.
