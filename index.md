## About Me

Hi, I'm Emma Tong, a student interested in building things.  
This project was part of my final quest in Programming Fundamentals, and it reflects what I’ve learned about Python.

## About My Project

**Project Title:** *MCU Directory*   
**One-line pitch:** A directory that shows you what Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) projects you should see before tagging along to see the latest MCU movie.
